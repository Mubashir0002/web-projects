                <h2>Founder of Pakistan</h2>
                <p>Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, <b>Jinnah</b> was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England.
                     Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice.
                     Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century.
                     In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu-Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent.
                     Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. 
                     In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha,which he regarded as political anarchy.</p>
